This report provides FGP management with insights into the value of FGP Customer Loyalty Program to each merchant member - Fast Food, Grocery and Petrol. With the aim of expanding the program, it is essential for FGP to understand the current value of its loyalty program to its business partners. From that, FGP would identify the root cause behind occurring complaints, pre-empt potential issues to ensure merchant membersâ€™ satisfaction with the program, as well as reveal opportunities for program expansion.  

This project used R programming to conduct data analysis and create data visualization to support insights and suggestions. It is the group project under MARK3054 course of University of New South Wales.
